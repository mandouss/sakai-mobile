_**Features**_:

We have set up sites view (for programs), sites subview (for functions in each program), assignment view and gradebook view.

Click on each program, the view will be redirected to sites subview, which has an assignment view block and a gradebook view block.

When clicking assignment view block or gradebook view block, a table of assignments or gradebook will be displayed.

At the bottom of each view, there are three buttons: Sites, Calender and Settings. Currently, only the Sites button can be clicked and redirected to the Sites View.


Task distribution:
